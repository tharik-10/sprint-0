## **Purpose**

The purpose of this document is to explain the significance and usage of the requirements.txt file in Python-based projects. This file acts as a centralized list of dependencies required to run, test, or deploy the project. By maintaining this file, teams can ensure consistency across development environments, streamline setup processes, and avoid compatibility issues caused by untracked or mismatched package versions. 

## What is `requirements.txt`?

The `requirements.txt` file is a standard Python convention used to **list project dependencies**. It defines all the external libraries (packages) that your Python project needs to run successfully.

---

## Why is `requirements.txt` Important?

-  Ensures **consistent environment setup** across different machines and deployments.
-  Helps automate installation of dependencies using a simple command (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
-  Essential for **collaboration**, CI/CD pipelines, and production readiness.
-  Supports reproducibility in **Docker**, **virtual environments**, and **cloud deployments**.

## Use Cases

| Scenario                         | How `requirements.txt` Helps                                      |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  Team Development              | Everyone installs the same versions, preventing "it works on my machine" issues |
|  Deployment to Servers         | Easily install all dependencies in production                     |
|  Setting up CI/CD              | Automate dependency installation before testing/build             |
|  Docker Image Creation         | Add to Dockerfiles to streamline image build                      |
|  Virtual Environments          | Pairs perfectly with `venv` or `virtualenv`                       |

## Versioning Best Practices

Version control is **crucial** to avoid conflicts and bugs when dependencies change over time.

| Syntax               | Meaning                                      | Example                      |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `package`            | Latest version (not recommended)             | `requests`                  |
| `package==1.2.3`     | Exact version (most stable for prod)         | `flask==2.2.3`              |
| `package>=1.2.0`     | Minimum version allowed                      | `pandas>=1.4.0`             |
| `package<=2.0.0`     | Maximum version allowed                      | `tensorflow<=2.14.0`        |
| `package~=1.4.5`     | Compatible release (same major/minor)        | `numpy~=1.24.1`             |
| `# comment`          | Comments are allowed                         | `# Core HTTP library`       |

---

## Best Practices

-  **Pin exact versions** (`==`) for production deployments.
-  Use **compatible versions** (`~=` or `>=`) during development.
-  Add **comments** next to packages for clarity.
-  Avoid mixing system-level packages with project-specific ones.
-  Regularly test and update dependencies to avoid vulnerabilities.
-  Generate using `pip freeze > requirements.txt` for complete snapshots.
