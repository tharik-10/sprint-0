# 📘 Version Control System (VCS) 

## 📌 What is a Version Control System?

A **Version Control System (VCS)** is a tool that helps developers manage and track changes to source code over time. It allows multiple people to work on the same codebase, keeps a history of changes, and facilitates collaboration and code recovery.

---

## 🎯 Why Use a Version Control System?

- Track changes and history
- Collaborate across teams
- Revert to previous versions
- Branch and experiment without affecting production
- Increase code quality and reliability
- Backup source code securely

---

## 🧰 Types of Version Control Systems

### 1. **Local VCS**
- Stores versions on a local machine
- Example: RCS (Revision Control System)

### 2. **Centralized VCS (CVCS)**
- Single central server stores all versions
- Developers check out and commit to this server
- Examples: CVS, Subversion (SVN), Perforce

### 3. **Distributed VCS (DVCS)**
- Every developer has a full copy of the repository
- Enables offline commits and full version history locally
- Examples: Git, Mercurial, Bazaar

## ✅ Advantages of VCS

- Easy rollback and history tracking
- Supports team collaboration
- Branching and merging support
- Backup and disaster recovery
- Detailed changelogs and auditing

---

## ❌ Disadvantages of VCS

- Learning curve for new users
- Merge conflicts can be complex
- Large binary files may bloat repositories
- DVCS requires more local disk space
